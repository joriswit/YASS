YASS offers two independent features:
* Search for solutions of Sokoban puzzles.
* Search for improvements of existing solutions.

Solving and optimizing Sokoban puzzles are complicated tasks for a computer program, so the program can only handle small puzzles.

YASS for Android can integrate with any Sokoban clone that supports solver plug-ins, like Soko++ or BoxMan.

YASS for Android is based on YASS for Windows and other operating systems made by Brian Damgaard. See the official download page: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sokobanyasc/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/sokobanyasc/</a>
